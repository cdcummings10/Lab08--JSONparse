# Console Parse Manhattan Neighborhoods

Lab08-JSON-Parse

*Author: Chris Cummings*

----

## Description
This app runs through a JSON data file and filters out all the neighborhoods in the data.
There are five different queries that are run on the data, which are:

1) A query of all the neighborhoods based on the data.

2) A query of all the neighborhoods that have a name (no blanks).

3) A query of all distinct neighborhood names.

4) A query of all distinct neighborhood names again.

5) A query of all the neighborhoods that have a name (no blanks) but with a different query format.
